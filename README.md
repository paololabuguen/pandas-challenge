# pandas-challenge

In this challenge, we analyze the overall passing rates of different schools. We break it down by analyzing
overall passing rates by grades, school size, school type and budget. The summary and analysis is included
in the py_city_school.ipynb file which draws some conslusions based on the data observed in the csv files 
in the Resources folder.

Th assignment uses the PyCitySchools.ipynb file provided with the assignment starter codes as a reference 
when writing the steps in the jupyter notebook and copies some parts of them into the py_city_school.ipynb
file.
