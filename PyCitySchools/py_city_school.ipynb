    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this project, we analyze the passing grades of students in different schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "One conclusion we can draw from this analysis is that Charter schools have an overwhelming advantage in overall passing compared to District schools. We can see this from the \"Highest Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)\" and the \"Lowest Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)\". The top 5 performing schools are Charter schools and the bottom 5 performing schools are District schools. Charter school students have an overall passing rate of 90.43 % compared to District schools which have an overall passing rate of 53.67 %.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another conclusion we can draw from this analysis is that schools spending more per student tends to yield a lower overall passing rate. In the section \"Scores by School Spending\", we see that schools spending <$585 per student have an overall pasing rate of 90.37 %, schools spending $585-630 per student have an overall passing rate of 81.42 %, schools spending $630-645 per student have an overall passing rate of 62.86 % and schools spending $645-680 per student have an overall passing rate of 53.53 %.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, there is a huge difference in overall pasing rate for small to medium schools compared to larger schools in terms of number of students. In the section \"Scores by School Size\", we can see that schools with less than 1000 students have an overall passing rate of 89.88 %, Schools with 1000 to 2000 students have an overall passing rate of 90.62 % and schools with 2000-5000 students have an overall passing rate of 58.29 %.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, from this data, we can predict that Charter schools that have less than 1000 students that have a spending budget of less than $585 per student would have a better overall passing rate compared to other schools. \n",
